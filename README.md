# Mobile-Programming-Assignment--1

Here, the task is to create an app that uses several views with at least a Button and Spinner with the listeners "setOnClickListener" and "onItemSelectedListener".

I have made a simple app to compute the price of meat items and produce items and made a spinner to show the list of modes of payment.


**Home Page**

Upon selecting any of the two buttons, we can go to the next activity (i.e, the next page)

**Produce Page**

When selecting checkout, it goes to the next activity for different modes of payment
